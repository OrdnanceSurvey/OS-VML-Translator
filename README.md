**OS VECTORMAP® LOCAL - TRANSLATOR TOOL**
**A tool to translate OS VectorMap® Local GML into Shape and TAB formats**

**OVERVIEW**
This translator translates Ordnance Survey Vector Map Local .gz files that contain GML into Shape or TAB format.  
It is anticipated that the tool and the accompanying code can be developed further by OS Partners and/or developers.

**RECOMENDATIONS FOR USE**
The tool can be used to convert smaller tile areas; such as bespoke County areas.  The tool is not recommended for much larger datasets, for instance a national set.
The tool has been tested successfully in scenarios processing volumes up to 100 tiles containing significant data.
Whilst the tests have proven positive results, more extensive use is done so at the users own risk with both hardware and software capabilities a contributing factor to outcome.  This may also vary dependant on the geographic information system (GIS) in use.
